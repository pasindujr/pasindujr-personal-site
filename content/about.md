Second-year developer student. My passion for web development brought me to the [Sri Lanka Institute of Advanced Technological Education](http://www.sliate.ac.lk/), where I am working on my higher national diploma in Information Technology.

The most valuable lesson I have learned from SLIATE has been the importance of consistency and practice whatever you do. This year I have practiced JavaScript, PHP and CSS. I continue to build skills in different technologies. Soon, I hope to complete a company internship that will provide real-life experience and important technological skills.
