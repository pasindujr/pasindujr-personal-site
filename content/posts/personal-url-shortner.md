This is to roll my own short URLs (Sometimes those URLs are actually not short ðŸ˜‰, I just created this and connected a domain I own for the fun and that's all.) 
This is how I created and deployed this.

 1. Create a new repository inside your favorite git hosting service (In my case its GitHub.)
 2. Inside the repo, create ``_redirects`` file without any extension.
 3. Inside the file, type your "short-paths" and "long-URLs" like this.
 
```
/a-short-path   http://some-place-on-the-web
...
```
4. You can put as much as fields as you want and make sure you put a space/s between short path and long path.
5. Go to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), create an account and deploy the above created repo connecting your Git hosting service. Need help? Check [documentation](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/09/29/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-on-netlify/).
6. You will be provided a Netlify-created sub domain and you can change it for whatever you want.
7. That's it. With the power of âœ¨Netlify's optimized edge redirects via it's redirects APIâœ¨, Now you have a "Personal URL Shortner". You can connect your own domain if You have one.
