This software system will be a donor and blood packet management system for the local blood bank. The system will be designed to maximize the productivity by providing tools to register donors and automating the SMS delivering process, which would a welcoming addition to already existing legacy systems. This will maximize the efficiency of the blood donation process and encourage the blood donors.

More specifically, this system is designed to allow staff of donation campaigns to register new donors, edit current donorsâ€™ details and make donation submissions through a web portal. This web system will facilitate synchronization between blood campaigns, local blood banks and the central blood bank. Additionally, the system will send an SMS notifying donors when their blood is being used with a personalized message. The system also contains a relational database containing a list of Donors and additional information.
